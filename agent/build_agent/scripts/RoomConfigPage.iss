; Room Configuration Page for Inno Setup
; This file is included by the main inno.iss script
;
; This is a placeholder for a custom page script.
; Since we're using built-in Inno Setup functions (CreateInputQueryPage) for our room configuration,
; this include file exists primarily for organization and potential future expansion.

; No additional code needed as the configuration page is created in the main script
; using the CreateInputQueryPage function in the InitializeWizard procedure.
